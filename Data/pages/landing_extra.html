                Stolen Timelines is a fast paced platformer, where you play as a thief from the future, stealing artefacts from the past in order to meet the gang quota.
                <br>
                <br>
                I worked on creating a dynamic camera that would adapt to the player's movement and the terrain to provide a clear view of the environment without hindering the gameplay experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                The other mechanic i was responsible for was the rewind ability, allowing the player to avoid fatal traps. A visual effect was added to the player when the ability was used to clearly indicate the ability was active.
                <br>
                The ability would also influence the in-game time, rewinding it as the player used it allowing them to gain more time within the level.

                This project was completed during the Global Game Jam 2024.
                <br />
                <br />
                Responsible to the mechanics design and programming, the notable mechanics i worked on were AI and the ragdoll physics.
                <br />
                <br />
                The AI was created using a pathfinding algorithm and a state machine to allow the enemy to chase the player once they entered their vision cone.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nearly all objects in the game were interactable, allowing the player to throw objects at the enemy to ragdoll them. The enemies would then be given an impulse force to knock their ragdoll back.
                <br>
                <br>

                Post-Poned is a light-hearted, 3D puzzle game where you play as Keith, the postman.
                <br>
                <br>
                I worked on the level design, camera and the conveyor mechanic puzzle.
                <br>
                <br>
                The camera mimicked a CCTV cameras, being able to rotate left and right from a fixed point. The camera speed and position was fine tuned to provide a clear view of the environment to not hinder the gameplay experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                The conveyor belt puzzle was comprimised of a list of gameobjects that would spawn in sequence that had to be scanned by the player. Each object needed the player to press the right buttons in order to progress.

                This project explored how games handle online play, focusing on which network architecture is best for small-scale games and development and which API best fits the network type.
                <br>
                The outcome consits of a basic, playable prototype allowing players to host or join a server.
                <br>
                <br>
                Players join a host's server by entering the host's join code. The host communicates with the clients through a relay, bypassing the need to port forward.
                <br>
                <br>
                Within the game the players can move and shoot at other players, with the host synchronising player and projectile positions for all clients through the use of client and server RPCs.
